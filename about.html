				<header>
					<h2 class="mb-4">The Mentored Project</h2>
				</header>

				<p class="text-justify">
					The MENTORED project is a cooperative project among the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG),
					the
					Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), the University of São Paulo (USP), the Federal Institute of
					Santa Catarina (IFSC), the University of the Itajaí Valley, and Rede Nacional de Pesquisa (RNP). It
					has
					been selected as a thematic project in the MCTIC/CGI/FAPESP 2018 public call. The project has the
					following main goals: (i) Identify, model, and evaluate malicious behavior related to IoT; (ii) help
					in
					the construction of advanced and coordinated solutions to enable: prevention, prediction, detection,
					and
					mitigation of DDoS attacks; and (iii) provide to the scientific community in Cybersecurity a testbed
					to
					allow researchers to experiment their solutions regarding DDoS attacks.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h2 class="mb-4">Problem</h2>
				</header>
				<p class="text-justify">With the increasing IoT applications and their importance to the global economy,
					the communication
					infrastructures and services have shown to be an essential tool and a fundamental element to public
					well-being and economic stability. Concerns about the security of those systems and networks tend to
					increase. The malicious attacks on the Internet, the interruption due to physical factors, software
					and
					hardware failures, and human errors affect essential public services that operate through public
					telecommunication networks, leading to chaos. These perturbations reveal our society’s increasing
					dependency on those networks and services and the importance of protecting them. Their importance is
					increasingly reinforced through the definition of cybersecurity strategies worldwide, as in European
					countries, Asia, the USA, and Canada, which consider the cyberspace availability, integrity,
					authenticity, and confidentiality of data a big issue in the 21st century.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify">Therefore, ensuring cybersecurity has been a central goal for governments,
					companies, and society, both
					on a national level and internationally. Different reports of the European Commission highlight the
					necessity of security and resilience regarding the information and communication infrastructure,
					particularly considering the Internet's current advances through IoT and IoE. The latter connects
					many
					computer devices, many of them embedded in cars, industrial machinery, home appliances, and even in
					the
					human body, and offers services that require high availability, efficiency, and security. The IoT
					and IoE
					change the actual Internet model, expanding the scale, heterogeneity, and complexity of cyberspace
					significantly. They need different security solutions that consider their singular characteristics
					and
					requirements.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify">In Brazil, the Annual Report of Security Incidents of the <a
						href="https://www.rnp.br/" class="text-dark">Rede Brasileira de Ensino e Pesquisa</a> (RNP),
					produced by the <a href="https://www.rnp.br/en/sistema-rnp/cais" class="text-dark">Centro de
						Atendimento a Incidentes de Segurança</a> (CAIS) of the Ipê network, shows that
					until later 2017, CAIS sent 3.6 million notifications of incidents and vulnerabilities, reinforcing
					the
					huge necessity of cybersecurity. Besides that, CAIS highlights the importance and potential of an
					intelligent analysis of network data to the understanding (characterizing), prediction, and
					definition of strategies against attacks and threats. The modeling of attacks helps comprehend the
					behavior of attacks and threats, as in the early prediction of new occurrences and new types
					(unknown/zero-day) of attacks, reducing financial and moral damage to the institutions.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify">CAIS, a partner of this project, clearly reinforces that, despite RNP's efforts
					to implement methodologies
					to prevent and mitigate attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS, the defense against
					malicious activities in the Brazilian network of education and research continues to be relevant.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify">In this scenario, the challenge to maximize efficiency against attacks goes
					through the coordinated
					operation of three complementary defense axes: (i) prevention, (ii) prediction, (iii) detection, and
					mitigation of attacks. Typically, each IoT device communicates with an associated application on
					smartphones or tablets connected directly or indirectly over a central point (hub) or by the
					manufacturer's services in the cloud, mainly to remotely access IoT devices. It is also common for
					communication between IoT and manufacturer's servers for status updates or searches for software
					updates.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify">The local monitoring of IoT device flows as well as the interactions between the
					devices and external
					devices (neighborhood and Internet) and the imposition of obedience to flow policies by devices are
					currently treated as a way to prevent DDoS attacks using IoT devices (e.g., FlowFence, IoT-Flows).
					In
					order to treat IoT network scenarios without local prevention mechanisms or compromised security
					mechanisms,
					it is necessary to identify signs of attack preparation from the IoT devices' behavior in
					its early stages (prediction). As a complement, determining the behavior of botnets and developing
					techniques to detect and mitigate the attacks are still relevant to cases where prevention and
					prediction have not achieved success, given the complexity and big potential logistic, economic, and
					moral
					damages of those attacks to people, companies, and governments. Lastly, it is imperative that a
					large-scale experimentation environment allows the behavior analysis of attacks and the evaluation
					of
					proposed solutions.</p>

				<header>
					<h2 class="mb-4">Main goals</h2>
				</header>
				<p class="text-justify">The MENTORED project's main goal is to advance scientific knowledge, human
					resources training, and
					the enhancement of a group with international coverage to cooperate in research and innovation in
					systems
					and network security with the participation of academic institutions, a small company, and the
					government. Besides that, this project aims to identify, model, and evaluate malicious behavior
					associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) to help build advanced solutions for the prevention,
					prediction, detection, and mitigation of DDoS attacks.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">The specific goals are:</p>

				<!-- <ul class="pl-4"> -->
				<ul class="pl-4" style="position: relative;list-style: outside;padding: 0 1.5%;"></ul>
				<li>Objective 1: The design of a monitoring solution of IoT flows to prevent attacks and help the
					modeling, detection, and prediction of botnets and DDoS attacks;</li>
				<li>Objective 2: The risk analysis by the identification of botnets formed by IoT devices and the
					prediction of known and unknown (zero-day) DDoS attacks;</li>
				<li>Objective 3: The identification and classification of malicious behavior related to DDoS attacks
					and
					the proposition of a solution to detect and mitigate those attacks;</li>
				<li>Objective 4: The design and implementation of an experimentation environment (testbed), with
					access
					control, in which the solutions proposed in this project can be tested.</li>
